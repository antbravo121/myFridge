## Overview
### Description
myFridge takes the idea of "easy to cook" to a reality. With the idea in mind that most people aren't experienced in cooking, we made an app to make it easy for you. Our app uses Pinterest's way of displaying new foods/recipes that you may be interested in. Once you click on those foods/recipes there will be a page that will display the difficulty, cooking time, and number of ingredients.
